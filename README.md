# Low Level System Design - Parking lot

### Problem Statement
[Check here](problem-statment.md)

### Project Requirements

* JDK 1.8
* Maven
* For Unit Tests:
    * Junit 4
    * Mockito

### Compiling/Building and running the unit tests
Go to the project root folder and then run: ./bin/setup.sh

### Runing the project
NOTE: Before running, please make sure you do the above setup step. Otherwise it will not run.
The project can be run as follows in one of the two ways:

1) **Using file based input:**: It accepts a filename as a parameter at the command prompt and read the commands from that file.   
   ./bin/parking_lot.sh  <input_filepath>  
   Example: ./bin/parking_lot.sh  ./file_input.txt
2) **Using file based input:**: This will run the program in the interactive shell mode where commands can be typed in.  
   ./bin/parking_lot.sh


### Further Enhancements:

* Dependency injection: Currently dependencies are injected manually. We can use some
  dependency injection framework like spring.
* Exit command: Exit command is currently coupled with interactive mode only which makes
  it non-reusable.
* Parking strategy: Parking strategy is currently associated with `ParkingLotService`.
  Instead of that, it makes more sense to associate it with `ParkingLot`.
* Mode: Mode checking is currently done in main function directly. There could be a
  factory for that.
